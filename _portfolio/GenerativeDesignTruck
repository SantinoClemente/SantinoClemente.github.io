# About the Project

(Don't grade me yet) This project focuses on designing a lightweight truck hanger, including a motor mount, for an electric longboard, using generative design and powder bed fusion printing.
# Design and Generative Process

Generative design was used to achieve a lightweight, structurally efficient geometry for the truck hanger, integrating the motor mount for a brushless DC motor.

### Key Design Features:
1. **Material Selection**:
   - Nylon 12: Lightweight and flexible.
   - ALSi10Mg: Strong and rigid, suitable for high-stress applications.

2. **Integrated Motor Mount**:
   - Slots for motor adjustment were made precise belt tensioning.
   - Fits a 6374 brushless motor and a 285 mm belt.

3. **Optimized Geometry**:
   - Clearance for 90 mm wheels, 608ZZ bearings, axle rod, kingpin and other obstacle geometries.
   - Structural support for torque transfer while minimizing mass.

4. **Parametric Design**:
   - Load cases based on rider weight, motor torque and weight, and other load scenarios.
   - Constraint placed on the kingpin through-hole to simulate real world forces.

# Discussion

### Powder Bed Fusion and Generative Design in Industry
Generative design and  powder bed fusion have revolutionized industries like aerospace and automotive. A notable example is General Motors' use of generative design to consolidate 8 parts into 1 for seat brackets, reducing weight and improving strength. This process generates complex geometries that are impossible to manufacture with traditional methods, reducing assembly steps and optimizing performance.

### Load Cases and Structural Constraints
Proper load case definition is critical. For this project:
- **Forces Applied**: Rider weight (80 kg), motor torque (8 Nm) and weight, impact forces during landing, belt tension, shear forces on trucks.
- **Constraints**: Kingpin through-hole as a fixed point.
- **Outcomes**: Ensured structural integrity while maintaining a lightweight design.

### Nylon vs. Aluminum Outcomes
1. **Nylon 12**:
   - Lightweight and cost-effective for prototyping.
   - Limited strength and stiffness, not suitable for real-world riding.

2. **ALSi10Mg**:
   - Superior strength and thermal properties.
   - More expensive and requires contract manufacturing for metal SLS printing.

### Critique of Generative Design
Generative design offers amazing optimization:
- **Pros**:
  - Reduces material waste. consolidates components.
  - Ground-breaking for complex, high-performance applications that can't be manually designed.
- **Cons**:
  - High computational cost and reliance on software accuracy.
  - Limited applicability in designs requiring frequent modification.

### Applications
Generative design is best suited for industries requiring weight optimization and high performance. Parts ideal for generative design are aerospace brackets, automotive frames, and custom prosthetics.
