# About

Microfluidic devices are essential in fields like **chemical synthesis** and **biological assays**, where precise fluid mixing is required. However, due to the **laminar flow regime** typical in micro-scale channels, achieving thorough mixing can be challenging. Homogeneous mixers are designed to overcome these limitations, allowing for efficient mixing of fluid streams even at a microscopic scale.

# Design Rationale

Our design includes two inlets and two outlets for bidirectional testing of the device's mixing efficiency. The geometry, featuring a combination of **zig-zag channels** and other mixing elements, was carefully chosen to ensure consistent and thorough blending. The device dimensions were calibrated to fit on a standard microscope slide (25 mm x 75 mm), facilitating easy observation and analysis.

# Instructions for Assembly

1. **Print and Cure Mold**: 
   - The Fusion 360 CAD model of the mold was printed using high-resolution settings (0.025 mm layer height) on a Form 3+/4 SLA printer. The mold was cured to ensure flatness and stability.
   
2. **Parylene Coating**: 
   - To prevent PDMS adhesion and facilitate easy demolding, the printed mold was coated with parylene, creating a smooth and uniform surface.
   
3. **PDMS Casting**: 
   - Mixed SYLGARD™ 184 Silicone Elastomer at a 10:1 ratio and cast it into the mold. The device was then cured at 100°C for 1 hour.

4. **Plasma Bonding to Glass Slide**: 
   - The cured PDMS structure was bonded onto a glass slide using plasma treatment, creating a leak-proof seal.
