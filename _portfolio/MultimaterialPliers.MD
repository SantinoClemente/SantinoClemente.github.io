# About the Project

This project focuses on designing multi-material needle nose pliers capable of gripping and manipulating delicate components, such as through-hole resistors. These pliers integrate a flexible spring component made from TPU to facilitate MOBILITY, allowing continuous use without manual resetting.

Print-in-place models like these enable functional, multi-component designs that work immediately after being removed from the print bed, requiring no post-processing or assembly. By creating a flexible element in the model, we ensured the necessary motion without traditional hinges or added fasteners.

# Print-in-Place and Multi-Material Printing

Print-in-place technology is a powerful advancement in 3D printing, allowing for pre-assembled parts that function straight out of the printer. These parts can be printed as a single unit, which simplifies the assembly process and minimizes the risk of component misalignment. Common applications of print-in-place include gears, hinges, and tools where intricate motion is essential, like working wrenches or scissors.

### Materials Used in Print-in-Place
For functional print-in-place models, using a combination of **rigid and flexible materials** works well. In this design, we employed **rigid PLA** for the plier jaws and handles, and **95A TPU** for the spring element, balancing flexibility and durability.

# Design and Iterative Process
