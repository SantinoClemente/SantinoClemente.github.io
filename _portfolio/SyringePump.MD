# About

Many medical situations require a device to administer specific doses of fluids to a patient over long periods. While this would be inefficient or impractically expensive for human nurses to accomplish, syringe pumps, or infusion pumps, provide a reliable and inexpensive way to supply these doses to patients reliably in a controlled manner.

# Features


# Off-the-shelf parts required

# 3D printed parts required

# Arduino Code

# Fusion 360 model

# How to Operate
* Ensure that the pump is paused by pressing the leftmost button, the LED turns yellow when the pump is paused.
* Place the syringe with the desired amount of liquid to pump on the end support.
* Using the switches on the right of the display, adjust the carriage so that it touches the end of the syringe plunger.
* Use the potentiometer to adjust as desired the flow rate as seen on the display. 
* Press the leftmost button again to start the pump, the LED should turn green.
* As the pump runs, the display will show the current flow rate and time remaining.
* When the plunger reaches its limit, the carriage actuates a limit switch to stop the motor. The LED turns red to indicate that the run has ended.
